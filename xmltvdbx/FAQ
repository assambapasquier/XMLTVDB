Q: Why don't I have channel icons?

A: For at least the Zap2IT downloader, there's a separate program you need
   to run in order to get the icons.  The normal downloader will only
   reference icons that have already been downloaded, so until you download
   the icons, none will be referenced in the xml file, and thus xmltvdb
   won't know they exist.
